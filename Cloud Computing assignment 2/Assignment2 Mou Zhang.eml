Mou,

Thanks! Great job overall. For a few issues/errors that were not covered 
in class, please find some notes below.

* Q1(a): it’s better to list some of the issues with TCP in 
*datacenters* specifically. Most of the listed issues are general ones. 
Also, please explain why TCP is not optimal. A few of the reasons you 
give -- like this one: “The flow in the datacenter is a mix of short 
flow and long flow, short flows tends to have low latency while the long 
flow wants the high throughputs” -- seem relevant to datacenters but 
they do not elaborate on how TCP is not optimal.

* Q1(c): “The remedy is consistent with the end-to-end principle. This 
is because that this change has nothing to do with the content of each 
packet.” -- the end-to-end principle is not about changing the content 
of the packet or not. It’s an architectural principle about where 
functions should be placed, in the core of the network or at the edge.

* Q2(b): with the forwarding mechanism explained in the assignment 
(e.g., rules matching prefixes, different rules for each output port, 
etc.), what you explain is not implementable.

* Q2(c): you need to explain what the mechanisms exactly are, e.g., what 
are the rules (their match/action operations) for each stage of 
switches.

* Q4: What are the AS paths towards AS1 in (a) and (b)? For (c), you 
will need to explain why “AS2 does not know about the recover.” By 
default, it should learn that the link recovers. If you are constructing 
a scenario where it does not, your answer needs to explain why.

* Q8(b): how is this solution high-performance compared to the original 
MapReduce design?
