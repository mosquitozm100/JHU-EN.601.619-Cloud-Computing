The B4 network is a masterpiece from google. It is a great improvement from the Jupiter. Though they are both based on the theory of SDN, the B4 network solves a lot problem that Jupiter never think about. This is probably because Jupiter is the previous version and usability is the main consideration when building Jupiter.
The idea I like most is to divide data into 3 different categories by their importance and priority. One thing that really shock me is that the propotion of different kind of data. Most of things user view is data from personal host to server. But this only takes a little portion of all data flow. Surprisingly, data communication and synchronization is the main part of all data flows. By giving different categories of data different bandwidth in the Traffic Engineering part, B4 improves its efficiency significantly. This gives me a further idea: Using machine learning algorithm to decide how to classify different data and the bandwidth of different categories of data. This will increase the efficiency a lot comparing to set standards manually.
Another excellent property of this paper is that it Has good compatibility. By dividing the whole network into 2 separate parts, this architecture maximizes efficiency while retaining compatibility. But ont thing that is not good enough is that when a failure occurs, the ratio of the maximum utilization rate to the minimum utilization rate of the link in the edge network becomes larger, which indicates that there is still room for optimizing the load balancing strategy when a failure occurs
