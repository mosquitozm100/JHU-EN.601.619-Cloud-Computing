Google has fit the design of the Software-Defined Network with its own network structure well. And to solve the problem of connectivity, it seems that the routing protocol is used well ã€‚ The routing table is forwarded by the document, which makes it much easier to manage. However, the problem of robustness is still a problem. If the main server is down, all these switches are not able to get the routing table, and the whole system is down. We need a redundant master to avoid this problem. Therefore, if the master is down, the whole system can still work with the other masters.
