The author did an excellent job in this paper. His work has solved the bandwidth problems a lot wisely by managing the network in a new way. He established the fat-tree architecture so that all the hosts and switches are managed appropriately. The IP address is well-distributed so that you can easily find your target using just IP. The Routing algorithm and flow control algorithm are awesome and effective in this network. I believe the reason for the achievements is that the whole thing is well-structured., which provides convenience for designing the whole IP, routing and flow scheduling system and algorithms. However, it uses the all-knowing central scheduler to schedule the flow. So one flaw is that on the Internet, you are not the owner of all devices connected to the Internet. So it is unlikely to permutate all devices in such a simple and clear tree structure. So if you'd like to use this structure on the Internet, this will cost a lot of waste for the vacancy in the hosts' place in the structure. Besides, if there is only one central scheduler, the efficiency and the robustness are doubted because of the large amounts of requests and the possibility that the server is down. What's more, when you are using a flow scheduler, it may violate the privacy of hosts because maybe the host does not want to share the flow with the manager, but when using this system, everything must be checked by the scheduler.
