The idea of this paper is genius. This paper has done great work in modeling the whole network as a mathematical model. By combining the entire network system with operations on sets and functions, this paper provides an elegant way to check the requirement for setting networks. Besides, this paper also gives out a new direction to combine the network system with mathematics, which has great potential in the future. However, there are always problems when connecting the ideal math model to the practice. One problem in this work is that the perfect model is hard to deal with practical issues such as congestion and the limit of the bandwidth. Besides, in the math model, the states of the network are dynamic and hard to deal with a static model. This problem is significant when we find that the static model is slow comparing to the change in the network system.
