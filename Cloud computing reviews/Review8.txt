One thing I learned from this paper is that there's a long way to go from the theory to the actual work. Some information can only be gained from experience. In the Saturn and Jupiter part, the authors of this article have compromised between the previous methods to set up a Middle Block, which serves the best. This is why experience is so important. 
Besides, there are always unexpected thing happens when doing the actual work. As mentioned in this paper, dealing with outages is one thing that is hard to expect in theory period. Only through practice can we find these problems and find solutions to them.
Another thing mentioned in this paper that impressed me is the percentage of principal sources of congestion. Host serving as the most significant part of congestion is really out of my expectation. Owing to this condition, I suggest using other structures like jellyfish to organize the host level of the whole structure. Because jellyfish is more proficient than the traditional well-structured in communicating and since there are not many servers under one ToR, it's not hard to manage.
