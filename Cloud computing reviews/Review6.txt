This paper introduced a great job google has done in a decade about the famous google datacenter. It tells the whole process of building the Google data center from scratch. However, the structure has limited the number of hosts that can be connected to the network. I suggest that we can probably use a more complex hierarchical structure with more hierarchy to manage more hosts. Besides, the cost of building this network is huge due to the low utilization of data transmission. The data transferring in the datacenter varies from time to time. And at any time, only a small number of its ability to transfer data is used. To solve this problem, I suggest that we should shut down or turn on low power mode to several routers when the datacenter is bot busy as long as it does not affect the transmission of data. We should set up an autonomous server to adjust the number of the running servers to reduce to cost of power.
