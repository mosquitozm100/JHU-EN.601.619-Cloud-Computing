This paper has done excellent work in updating the routing tables in SDN. Even though it only consists of simple cases such as per-packet consistency and per-flow consistency, it solves the problem of updating the routing table. Although their ideas are excellent, I still find some issues in it. One is that if there are not only two configurations at a time, but more configurations. For example, you are using the 1st configurations and ready to change to the second configuration; at this time, the third configuration comes. What are you supposed to do to deal with this circumstance? How much data is going to use the second configuration?
Another problem is that if there are multiple configurations, the memory of the switch may not be able to store all these rules. What's more, it is not mentioned in the paper how the author is going to deal with packet loss. Packet loss is also a significant problem in today's network.
